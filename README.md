Twitter Mentions To Redbook Tasks
==================================

Rails application that creates a new Redbooth task each time a given screen name is mentioned in Twitter. 

This is **Mike Blake's** homework assignment for a job as a Rails developer at Redbooth, Barcelona.

> Dear applicant,
> Open a repo in Github (so we can see progress) and build a Rails app that integrates with the Twitter public API and the Redbooth API3 ([https://developer.redbooth.com/]). 
> The application creates a task in Redbooth each time somebody mentions a given handle in Twitter. Make the service ready to be integrated with other project management tools.
> Once it is ready, deploy the application somewhere (Heroku is the simplest option) so we can play with it easily.
